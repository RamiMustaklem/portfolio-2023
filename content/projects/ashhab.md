_[Website](https://store.ashhab.net/)_

Currently in the process of migrating the live site to the new site...

It consists of a main repository, that has a bash file that will clone and install 3 different repositories, API, Admin CMS and the Shop front.

The API is a Restful API built with Laravel that is consumed by the administration panel, a NextJS project, and shop front, which is also a NextJS project.

Functionalities include customer sign up and authentication, cart and checkout, and also simple and variable product types.
