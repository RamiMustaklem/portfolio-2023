  <p>
    Here are a few reasons why you would want to work with me:
  </p>
  <ul class="mt-5">
    <li>
      <strong>Planning & Organizing.</strong>
      A plan with a clear view of how the project is going to be is a factor in a project's success, even when I'm working alone I like to clarify, breakdown and organize the project's requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quality.</strong>
      I care about code quality even if the project is functional as needed or I'm working alone. I like to write tests when needed, unit tests, component tests or e2e tests.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance.</strong>
      I always take code performance into consideration, and run some tests to ensure high performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mobile first mindset.</strong>
      In today's web it's important to focus on the mobile, considering UI, UX and performance. Depending on the project's requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Containers, Cloud & Automation.</strong>
      I have experience using Amazon AWS's and Microsoft Azure's services, and deployment automation using Terraform. Docker and Docker Compose, Serverless technology.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility</strong> & Technical <strong>SEO</strong> is a very important aspect of every site and needs to be addressed properly with the necessary elements and schemas.
    </li>
  </ul>
